<p class="meta"> « This post is part of a series summarizing some interesting distributed systems. The motivation is to enhance my understanding of these systems and organize my personal notes. I'm inspired by the (excellent) blog <a href="http://the-paper-trail.org/">The Paper Trail</a>. » </p>

**MICA: A Holistic Approach to Fast In-Memory Key-Value Storage**
*[Hyeontaek Lim](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hl/), [Dongsu Han](http://ina.kaist.ac.kr/~dongsuh/), [David G. Andersen](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/), [Michael Kaminsky](http://www.pittsburgh.intel-research.net/people/kaminsky/)*

### Elevator Pitch
MICA achieves ~10x the performance of existing *single-server key-value stores* by designing from the ground-up for concurrency, optimizing for performance at every layer of the stack, and inventing useful new data-structures. Unlike many other similar systems, MICA offers excellent performance to write-heavy workloads as well.

### Key Ideas

1. MICA exploits CPU parallelism to partition data effectively. This essentially means that every partition can only be written to by a single core (and read by single or multiple cores depending on the mode of operation). While this is generally thought to cause issues for skewed workloads, the authors show that performance concerns are largely nullified by the higher cache hit-rate and more efficient packet I/O for popular partitions.
2. Using technology designed for software routers, MICA achieves zero-copy packet I/O by keeping all network functionality in userspace using Intel’s [DPDK](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/intelligent-systems/intel-technology/packet-processing-is-enhanced-with-software-from-intel-dpdk.html). Additionally, by using flow-level core affinity in conjunction with a smart(er) client library, requests for data can be directed to the right core by the NIC.
3. MICA can function in cache-mode or store-mode, but the performance of the two modes is surprisingly similar given all the optimizations in cache-mode. Essentially, cache-mode uses a circular-log and a lossy hash-table, which is augmented by bulk chaining into a lossless hash-table for store-mode. The data-structures are interesting enough to warrant more discussion than a short blog-post permits, but they are simpler than those seen in systems such as SILT, and are somewhat similar to LevelDB/RocksDB LSM trees.

### Overall

Using the techniques above plus about a half-dozen other excellent optimizations, the authors show that MICA can support tens of millions of operations per second on commodity server hardware without breaking a sweat. This paper is a brilliant example of what is possible when you can design and optimize a system full-stack.
